<p>I am a graphic designer and front-end web developer with a passion for finding elegant, clean and sophisticated solutions for my clients' print and web needs.</p>

<p>After earning a degree in fine art and political science from Sewanee: The University of the South, I began working as a project manager and junior art director at Flannel, a Vermont and California-based branding and web development agency where my clients included Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business and Okemo Mountain Resort.</p>

<p>It was there, as the understudy to an incredibly talented creative director, that I married my eye for design with the technical skills of web development and learned how to transform a website from artistic vision to seamless reality. </p>

<p>I began freelancing in 2010, as my husband's job in the Army requires us to move often, and I'm looking forward to opening my own business in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>I love collaborating with my clients, listening to their ideas and expectations and coming up with ways that my expertise can help them meet and exceed their goals. I'm also happy to take the reins on projects for clients who prefer less involvement in the creative process.</p>

<p>Either way, I strive to deliver products that look and function exactly as they were intended, with no small details overlooked. I thrive on challenging my creative and technical limits and I draw inspiration from, really, everything around me.</p>

<p>A few of my many favorite things in life are my husband, our dogs Luna and Hank, good music, good books, and good food. I value a healthy, holistic approach to life.</p>
