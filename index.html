<p>Hello. My name is <strong>Emily Flannery</strong>, or Emily Glass according to Harvard. This will be changing as soon as I can submit a name change form.</p>

<p>I was a political science and fine art major at <strong>Sewanee</strong>: The University of the South. I started out with a passion for design and that passion has translated into a passion for <strong>beautifully designed and built websites</strong>. I of course have much more to learn.</p>

<p>My husband and I recently bought a house in <strong>Austin</strong> where I will soon be job hunting. I am 100% confident this class will greatly broaden my horizons in the web development field.</p>

<p>I use BBEdit but intend to start using Sublime Text.</p>
